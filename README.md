'Vines!' is a 2D game that challenges the player to travel through a jungle from point A to B and back by swinging on Vines.
The game was initially developed over the course of 4 days for Brackeys Game Jam 2023.1 with the theme "An End is a new beginning."
The physics-based interactions combined with procedurally generated levels result in gameplay that is simple to learn with a surprisingly high skill cap, requiring dexterity and concentration.

Note: The journey out can be immersive, beautiful, and even relaxing. This is a good time to develop a flow state - you will surely need it to survive the chaotic trip back.
