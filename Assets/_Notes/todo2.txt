player has grab trigger collider
-- if in range of a swingable obj, and grab key is pressed, set isSwinging=true;
-- When isSwinging:
	- player main collider is set to trigger and player rb gravity = 0;


- reset jumps when swing movement is enabled from CharacterController2D

==========

TRY:
use normal velocity direct movement when play is not swinging and force-based movement when swinging.
-- try to figure out how to get effect of fixed joint without using one so player can ascend, descend vine.
	-- maybe just disable rigid body? 

=======

level gen

- trees:
	- setup procedural tree script, have that manage the production of vines from itself.
	- change levelgenerator to instantiate trees instead of vines.
