You are setting up the Palm and trunk sort order in treeFactory; review todo;

- framerate on windows (450+) when vsync should be set to 2 and target 60fps

- ui add option to toggle new record alters on screen allow

- create an "outpost" section preset.. like a largish walkable area and then on each side is the river and a series of torches or some extended marker of the output every n units for a length of x on both sides of the output..
  so like you're venturing into safe territory.. and then out of it as the "civilized" part disappears as the torches get fewer and fewer.. then

- create an in game section builder..

  - can edit all the inputs needed to make a level settings, then we can click to preview (show bottom half of screen), and an option to play.
    -- preview/play could show by having the UI fade out and back in seamlessly - each setting update would trigger a 100 unit section to preview.

- add a contious difficult that gradually wanders a difficult range as more terrain is produced

- MAKE slide work by not propelling you but allowing you to slide with inertia and even slide off the end.
  ... so use player weight and allow it to move along the vine (or restricted to down) - mvp.. use force on joint to determine if there's inertia?
  -- no.. us a reference object. set it to the same mass and inertia and then set it free and then while sliding, update us in the direction of that ref obj
  -- no just read rb inertia. can then

- make modifier that controls variables on level as it progresses.. e.g. treeheight can be sine wave, or linear increase or random

  - allow also to apply something like a linear gradual start section.. so there's always an easy way to get started from the platform.. then after maybe 20-50 units, the "real" params kick in.

- mp: setup controls; remove player related static fields; try shared vines or clone the vines, place them all sorted-=1, then color the adornments to match player's main(shirt) color. Ensure col layers are adjusted so each player can only interact with their row of vines.

  - additionally, the layers don't have to be identical.

- Confirm that assets are not included in production build

- camera zoom out slightly with velocity/height

===========

- check magnitude on reactiveForce of currentSeg and

- maybe start player on vine?

- Move this list into todos in proj
- Experiment with slide mechanic
- Complete LayerBuilderUI

- ground bg
  -- move bg foliage up onto ground and size appropriately
  -- try to set up mask or something that allows foliage on the bank to hang over the water (without being underneath, or behind)
- set bgfoliage start pos to start after player position (avoids starting platform being blocked by foliage
- position trees up a little and add base sprite that blends trunks into terrain
  -set up bg auto sort to account for which layers are on top of the ground
  ; otherwise you need to manually adjust ground sort layer

  bg
  -- add bg far tree layers with extra height;
  -- try moving bg trees to bg layer
  --- might need to move up higher and try moving mask up
  -- Setup BackgroundPreset; during playtime copy all bg objs from levelGen to the bg preset, then change levelGen to use a BackgroundPreset
  -- Update BG objs to have -10 to 10 rotation (probably less or none on large obj layers)

- place two palms for start camera to zoom through

- on start, zoom in and down toward player and smoothly land on a resting place.
  -- in gameplay, zoom out and in based on velocity/height

- Try IK anim
- Rebuild bg

============

Fade:

- [x] Finish testing
- [x] Save CrossFadeCanvas as Prefab
- [x] Test Scene switch
      -- [x] ensure SceneLoader custom onscene switch methods are working
- [x] Replace Calls to LevelLoader
      -- [X] Replaced calls in code; Need to hook up UI buttons(e.g. play btn) and some listener for "next scene" to replace levelLoader;
- [x] sceneloader not running onenable consistently; research or move to monobehavior

  - [x] is causing sceneTransition blocking flag to be true incorrectly; prevents subsequent scene loads

- [x] Ensure CrossFade canvas enabled status is correctly handled (e.g. if fade out but not fade in, it should be disabled on scene load)
- [x] Test scene reload and all scene transitions;
- [x] Setup CrossFadeCanvas on MainMenu
- [o] Look into using async loading with fade // setup async method on SceneLoader; Not tested
- [x] Experiment with running time forward on game manager after level gen // timeScale and Physics2D.Simulate did not work well
- [] Replace all UI and text animators with tween
- [] Setup management for other UI canvases on GameMain to avoid the GUI repaint calls and GC
  - [] maybe use single GameUI manager/controller for refs to all UI components and calls
- [] remove testing update code from CrossFadeCanvas
- [] \*\* Note: Crossfade state needs to be handled better between all transitions;

- [] (High) Refactor PersistantAudio; Will be singleton; Will Have two primary static tracks: Ambient and Music
  - [] Update consumers
  - [] Decouple IntroText scene from transition to gamemain
  - [] Ensure sounds and music are working across scenes as expected;
  - [] once working, remove code in SceneLoader.CustomUnload.UnloadGameMain() pertaining to persistant audio
- [] Ensure all UI elements are on UI layer

- [] Setup Singletons where applicable (e.g. GameManager; Can get ref to singleton instance and all static variables can just be public)

===

Env Preset

- [x] Set sprites to single; Rename, then resetup to get file name correct
- [x] Finish grass sprite setup
- [x] double check pivots
- [x] might need to adjust ppu for newer foliage sprites
- [] Move "bg trees" from tree layer to envpreset

- [] Remove testing key "N" from game mgr

==
LevelGen

- [x] Enabling Sorting group causes error with sortinglayer name; Fix

==========

- [] Bug: Jungle sfx stop after restart level // should be handled after refactor of PersistantAudio

=========

- Sunspots: - [] Review Keep notes 101623 - [] Make Dedicated sunspot shapes for various sections and create a new layer for each of those (e.g. some round shapes specifically targeting the background ground area (so, set the yoffset to try to target just the ground; and set those up on their own layer) - Do the same for water-specific sunspots; - [] Consider Just having trees manage their own sunspot generation: - can config sunspots in the treeConfig; E.g. pct chance trunk sunspots, palm sunspots, etc... maybe just surrounding sunspots? - Then the trunks can pick from specifically designed trunk-sunspots and position/scale them in a way that's more consistent than random external placement

      - [] Also, lightshafts can have a sunspot generator at the end of it.

  =========

NOTE:

- [x] RNG is broken (noticed 101623)
  - Remove sunspots to see if that was it; if not, reduce levelgen processed until you find where it's breaking and address.

============

- [x] Vine sorting behind and in front of player (setup two sections of Default sorting order ranges, one where it is now with vines and adorns.. and another in front of player, but before palms)
  - [] May want to try always having player's active vine behind the player; So just switch the sort order upon a grab.
- [] Palm rigging and setup IK anim that plays when player lands on vine.. Can manually set targets down and up with a distance proportional to the downward force from the player landing on the vine.
  - can maybe use the reaction force of the first segment attached to the anchor segment.. use that force to apply direction and distance to a palm's target bone
  - [] need to repack palm atlas after rigging
  - [] You can update the anchorpoints on the palms to include the associated palm frond IK target; Then, when you assign a vine to an anchor, provide the IK target to the vine root.. and the vine root can then call the effect on that target when the player is on the vine.

==========

- [] Vines: Implement better suspension init method; Start with all off-screen suspended; then choose a random 5-10 vines to be unsuspended for 1-2 seconds, then requeue them and repeat until all vines have been unsuspended for the set init amount of time (say, 10 secs); This will allow all vines time to get into resting state without letting them all do it up front; Probably also want to prioritize the vines closest to the player first.
  -- [] Track down Mem issue in VineSuspenseManager; Reimplement and get working

=====
Testing Vine FastForward on load

- [x] Make LevelGenerator a monobehavior and set up an obj with it;
- [x] Make factories static and reference their instances in LevelGen
- [x] Finish Setting up the FF time in levelGen.InitLevel()
- [] Implement the Vine FF/Suspension on endless segment generation

  - [] could actually probably run it by just having the section gen complete method;
    - maybe call it on VineFactory.OnSectionComplete; And vinefactory can manage a list of vinesRefs it's created which can be reset in order to only reference/operate on all segments created in that section;
    - Or, maybe just manage this by tracking the vineRefs (along with other obj refs) in a Section object.

- [] Revisit the Coroutine in LevelGen.InitLevel(); Commented out until GameManager is setup to handle all actions needed after level load complete;

- [] Since LevelGen is now a mono, we can move the behavior from GameManager update to levelgen for tracking player and handling endless regen;

====
Trees:

- [x] Ensure random flip is applying to trunks and palm sprites

====
water:

- [x] Check the render texture size (saw in frame debugger.. 2000x600 or something) Might be related to why the scale is odd.

===
RNG:

- [] review the init seed; seems to be retaining -1 or 0 if static \_seed not set;
- [] RNG Broken

===
Canvas:

- [] ensure pause screen has closer distance than crossfade

====
Background/Env obj Shader ?

- [] Curious if we can build a shader that just places the sprites of each layer on a texture according to the placement rules.. then we can use a single object/mesh for each bg layer (that needs parallax, otherwise they can be all on one obj); And resize it or move it along with the player and the textures rendered are just as they are in worldspace according to the generation rules.. Then we can totally remove the need to place actual objects.. ? Sounds cool.

===
Record system:

- [] setup minimums for init record setting so player is not bombarded with record notifs at the start of every new game (after install)

=====
BUILD ISSUE

- [x] null refs; guessing related to the singleton factories

=====

- [] Add water buoyancy flow with water speed

=====

- []

=====
For jungle canopy above and below: - want some big hangy leaves from an angle of below (from a distance).. place a continuous layer of these at the y height where you want the jungle canopy to be (canopyHeight). - then, place a mask in follows player that goes up to the height of the canopyHeight.. so these sprites will only be visible from below their y - above that, use another mask that masks out the previous "from below" canopy sprites and now shows a "from above" canopy layer.

====

Make universal SuspenseManager - Assign to Objects you want to suspend, eg. vines, trees with rigs, or RBs
... then have components just add themselves to the OnSuspend/OnUnsuspend actions
... Then the Suspense trigger (OnVisible, or player-bound large trigger collider) can search those objects and let inform them when they should be or not be suspended

====
sounds:

- [] SFX: place all sfx scripts into one, create struct to contain different groups of audioclips.. - we can reference
  ====
  place sunspots parent and lightshafts into a lights container
  ====
  use IK to randomize plant shapes for variety - set up IK on all plants, - setup system for each to randomize the positions (could start by just using a general rule to shift each target around in a radius randomly - then disable/enable IK with visibility (suspense-like system with resuspend delay)
  ====
  use ik for palm screen transition; - play palm sound (like landing on vine) + a swoosh/woosh sound.
  ===
  Coconuts:

make coconuts fall from palms with vine force; coconut hits player on head and they lose grip - play grunt and like bowling pin knock sound

TODO:

- Still need to:
  -- finish coconut physics (joint/or kinematic at start)
  -- setup system that allows coconuts to fall as needed (e.g. when player shakes tree via vine)
  -- implement collision between player and coconut with effects on player (e.g. hit to head causes player grab release; may not interact with other player colliders.)
  -- implement water splash with coconut impact (this requires general water splash system to be setup)

Coconut wip copied from external notes:

- [x] Create prefab
- [o] add to tree factory and tree settings (pct chance coconut & max coconuts)

  - [] create and place at tree anchor points
  - [] also, add tree ref to vineroot;
    - [] when force on vine, shake the coconuts, and determine chance of release (on some minForce value)

- [] add collission with player head triggers sounds and releases player grab

- [] set coconut density for water
- # [] update water to generate splash with any impact; based on the size of the object impacting, and the force
- after coconut is released, set collider exlcude layers back to Nothing (i set default to Everything.. so, it wont interact with anything until it's released)
- []

===
fix pause by not listening to onGrabRelease (method or input) when paused. - also, may be good to just disable all player interaction when paused.

====
make default names of characters people we know..
-e.g. George C., Denise Z. or we can mix it up like Dennis Zatko; George Clerk, etc.

=====

change amulet to golden goose

=====
add floating logs downstream

====
you can add a bug that lands on a vineseg, hangs out, then flies off and lands on another vineseg; - bring net back in to catch these. - bug can land on front of vine, or on either side; - make the net interact with any vine that the player's swinging on - when flying,..idk, maybe make it interact with none? or maybe just not any player is close to (like on top of)

====

to get lights to dynamically show on trees: - have object that holds several colliders, and, when placed, have it find all nearby trees, then place colliders on them resized to match, then it can test for collisions at the angle of the sun.. we can then place an appropriate light on the object - we can actually setup a specific collider for each prefab... then the Object has all those ready to go, and for each object it wants to test, it can reference the instantiated collider prefab, scale, rotate, and position it to match the one it wants to test,

    - place this object like any other env object and then it can create sunspots

====

for IK: - system that simply allows toggle of locking the sprite to the rb. - whenever you want to perform a specific anim, just toggle to unlock, then trigger anim, and use IK target to lerp it back into place of the rb. - I think actually, if we use a full ragdoll.. we can keep the ragdoll going at all times, and then when lockToRb is toggled on, we lerp the target to the associated target on the rb.. can also do this at a given strength like what we're currently doing;

    	- if we need to, we can easily make this go both ways.. instead of a toggle that locks the sprite to the rb, just toggle which one is the master, and apply the methods to lerp the other. i.e. rb.moverotation/position to transform ; or move IK target to rb target (may need to position a specific target equivalent on the rb part)
    		- also, we can add option to have both lerp towards eachother simultaenously..				-- this can be used when we need to switch from pure animation to physics quickly.. like imagine him balancing on a log, and legs are IK'ing the log as he finds his balance.. moving around with CG..  but his arms are kind straight up, waving via pure animation (the physics arms are completely on their own, maybe down at his sides).. then the player inputs to walk, so we trigger a merge, and the rbs start moving up toward the arm transforms, and the IK targets start moving down toward the RB targets, and they will end up meeting in the middle, then able to continue into the next anim, having exited the previous state in a belivable way.

    - anim idea: when he lands with part of his collider on an edge (i.e. tiptoes) we can trigger anim where he bends at the waste, leaning forward, and waving to get his balance. This could put his cg in front, and also, with IK, trigger footsteps forward.

    - With the IK sys above, you can create a much better landing animation..and probably allow him to just smack onto the platform.. if you can figure out how to get him back up again, lol. But you can move the targets in a way that would make him like try to break his fall.. like just put his arms toward the platform is he's falling sorta head-first.. and have them fly upward if he's falling feet first..
    	- actually, you can just make this a general rule for falling.

    - for running, when space is pressed/held down, move the spine bone down a little.. this will move him into a sort of crouched pre-jump pose regardless of whether he's running.

    -

======

setup system that allows me to vary presets of background/environment types over the course of the level - e.g. background space is more open.. field.. maybe some structures or something can go in.. but also, then you can ensure that there is a large light over that space, to solidify the illusion.

- the default layer can have it's own section types too
  - You can design specific sections around challenges..
    - e.g. a section where he has to go over a man eating plant.. we could ensure the vines kinda lower down to the path of the mantrap, such that it forces the player to engage with it.. so could be that the mantrap attacks in some pattern..like maybe after it snaps at the player, it takes like 5 seconds to reopen it's mouth.. which gives the player a window to sneak past... so the game is to swing close to the plant to bait it in to biting, but missing you, then you swing past it while it recovers.

- [] Webgl not picking up if platform is mobile
- [] Mobile restart screen not working (buttons highlight, but no action)
