- Store player stats since last swing grab.
-- max Velocity (x,y)
-- distance travelled (x,y) (since last grab)
-- Player rotations (amount and speed)

- Use the stats to derive score functions


An end grab bonus, especially when done with high downward velocity (i.e. a close save)

- when player starts a new grab:
-- check the max velocity 


===

Approach 1:

- Set up scriptable object class that contains score vars and methods
- for swing-related stats:
    - Trigger stat record from SwingingController (i.e. swingStart and swingEnd)


====

-- Use stunt or other things like the end grab as sequence for achievements (e.g. 10 end grabs awards achievement/something similar)
--- achievements can be used to unlock hats
---- hats may each have specific buffs like +10% jump power, etc.
