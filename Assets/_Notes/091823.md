Visuals:

- foreground:

  - fix sand

    - at least use thinner grafient + some shading

  - CameraForeground plants:
    - adjust sprites used + spacing; Lower offset
    - add angle

-Background: - revisit bg layer sprites - more regular bg trees - use these to fill in upper levels of palms - add bg vines to bg trees (remove bg vines layer) - more foliage - Resize Large flat bg trees - experiment with parallax

    - Add background layer of bg lightshafts; Maybe could setup on a Bg Tree prefab; They are more transparent and only affect background (or nothing)

    - Add bg Tree sort layer and instantiate with random sortOrder to prevent flickering

- Trees:

  - Setup Trunk Prefabs with palm placement anchors
    - update tree factory to use these.

- Vines:

  - Test using rb.Sleep when they are out of range //tested NoSleep and No active control on PC; not wbgl;
  - Consider running time forward at high speed while trees/vines are being placed in order to get them to settle into resting positions
  - Consider testing a linerenderer deactivation on out of range
  - ensure vineRoot (and probably all objects are destroyed after falling below a given y value)
  - In SwingingController, replace getNextSegment with VineSegment.GetNextSegment/GetPrevSegment; This will reference VineRoot.GetSegmentAtIndex

    - Also, ensure detached segments are re-indexed

  - for climbing: Try having player hinge onto a special object that is attached to the vine via a distance joint.
    - then, when climbing, set the distance joint to the target segment, and reduce the distance over time..Then update the target segment as the climb continues... might allow for smooth climb

- Arrows:

  - review collider and ensure they are hitting swingables

- Lights:
  - on webgl, set lightshaft blend style to multiply; Disable shadows
  - Experiment with RenderSettings (light render texture scale, etc.) in Settings folder/Renderer2D

-Player: - walking back and forth causes grunt noise; adjust bottom collider and legs colliders - Fix Swinging unpause - Check Amulet Colliders (might be the win platform collider, or the new player colliders; if the latter, try changing torso to box collider and ensure settings match orig collider.)

- Factories:

  - change Generate methods to Instantiate
  - FactoryConfigs should maybe be changed to Blueprint and keep the object config ; EnvironmentObject is currently the opposite of this
  - consider changing scales to scale multipliers instead of applying absolute scaling

- Add mobile controls and test

  - use Application.isMobileBrowser() to id mobile webgl devices
  - for mobile climb; may need to setup custom control that allows player to slide finger above and below the grab button (while grabbing)
    ... to climb up and down;

- Water:
  - adjust death trigger y pos

- UI
  -dl font ("Super easy")

  - Main Menu

    - Add options screen
      - quality settings:
        - adjusts lightshaft number;
        - Vsync

    Escape/Pause Menu: - stylize - add current stats

    - may need to manually set grab to true if player was grabbing on pause
    - include seed for copying

  - Add zone near amulet that, on enter, triggers "I can see the amulet ahead text"

  - speed up fade in text rate
  - review intro text
  - On win, allow restart/menu
  - review about page (add link elsewhere)
  - change start menu upper right text

==========================================================================================

- Data Persistance: - set up save/load for: - settings - scores and stats

      - Use ScriptableObject PlayerData
      	- Allow different characters? enter name?
      	- Save stats PlayerPrefs.setString(${playerName}+"/"+stats+"/"+maxSwing, etc
      		... same with cloth colors;
      		... Add to currency? Allow colors and clothing items bought with currency?

      	- ** Use ToJsonUtility
      		- we can save serializable classes
      		- try saving json string to string in player prefs; otherwise might need to check how Application.persistantDataPath works in webgl
      		- Setup a serializable class that represents the data to be saved, eg. PlayerStats


      - Fix save

==========================================================================================

- Gameplay:

  - Modes:

    - ArcadeMode (with jump) ?
    - EndlessMode: both sandbox and progressive difficulty:

      - achieve by generating sections of fixed length
        ... when player is nearing the end of the section (use some object as reference),
        ... generate a new section starting at the end of the old one and move or recreate the reference obj to the end of the new section;

        - For progressive difficulty, you can just increase spacing, height variance, vine weakness, and maybe chance of enemy encounter
          ... for enemy encounter, have the enemy engage from behind and last a period of time or for fixed distance that player must travel.. music fades out after the player escapes.

      - EndlessMode: review placement of new sections; ensure they're accounting for parallax

        - seems to be weird artifacts when new section is generated; Also maybe seems like bg might be overllaping? but don't see how.
        - You could also just init endless mode to be a really large length, then start extending if the player ever gets there.
        - Or, you could init a large initial section, then init the next section one layer at a time, depending on how close the player gets; so should be less noticable.
        - similarly, progressive danger mode can be sorted out ahead of time, each section placed at the beginning; then at the end, just extend the most difficult chunks.
        - Also, look into async instantiation; Maybe via coroutine to avoid stutters.. this might allow extending by larger chunks at a time.
          - maybe try corutine that instantiate one object per frame? yield waitfroendofframe
        - Maybe try using static Factories; Time the generation time of a length 10000 chunk with and without statics;

        - Or reuse objects from the beginning, reposition them every N units of distance, store the old positions in an array, and you can place them back if the player goes backward.

- Implement Difficulty coefficient and integrate it with treeSpacing, height, vine strength/pctWeak, pctChanceEnemyEncounter

- Setup Reusable Sections for endless mode

- Endless Format:
  - Player Travels and can reach platform check points where they can stop/save and perform actions

# \*\* Check phone notes 092023

======= DONE: ===============

- platforms should slow player movement so they don't slide off.
- Add climbing instructions to Controls UI notification
- replace bg bottom gradient
- Level Edges: test bg
- move vine adornments into single object;
  - use scriptable object sprite pool to get a random adornment sprite;
- fix ground
  vines: - when they break, add bouancy; Need to scale hat buoyancy wider
- changing level messed up splash position
- vine anchor segment: remove disable hinge
- Whereever else references a list of sprites, also move that into a sprite pool scriptable obj
- LightShaftFactory: review todo about Finding distance to ground before setting rotation
- Remove manual seed set before prod;
- palms5 has upside down palm
- Add random palm rotation
- Escape/Pause Menu: When pressing escape, pause and show menu - contains: - restart button - new game option
- fix fps and escape buttons on webgl
- Add Start and End vines
- Fix Vines at startMenu (missing now because we need the factory to generate)
- Fixed palm flickering
- Replace VineOverrideZone with manualTree placement; This ensures a vine is near.
- Set foliage in front of trees to be behind vine
- Update palm sorting
- Add vine links in Root; experiment with line renderer; On break, split vine at that index, add VineLine to that segment
