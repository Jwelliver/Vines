Visuals:

- foreground:

  - fix sand

    - at least use thinner grafient + some shading

  - CameraForeground plants:
    - adjust sprites used + spacing; Lower offset
    - add angle

-Background: - revisit bg layer sprites - more regular bg trees - use these to fill in upper levels of palms - add bg vines to bg trees (remove bg vines layer) - more foliage - Resize Large flat bg trees - experiment with parallax

    - Add background layer of bg lightshafts; Maybe could setup on a Bg Tree prefab; They are more transparent and only affect background (or nothing)

    - Add bg Tree sort layer and instantiate with random sortOrder to prevent flickering

- Trees:

  - Setup Trunk Prefabs with palm placement anchors

    - update tree factory to use these.

  - tree layer sorting:
    - upper/larger palms should be positioned in front of lower palms
    - larger trunks should be positioned behind smaller trunks
      - assume layer 0 is front-most; set trunk sort to baseTrunkSort - layerNum; set palm sort to base palm sort \_ layerNum
        ... Palms: TreeFactory.palmSortOrderList.Count + 10 \* layerNum + 1
        ... Trunks: TreeFactory.baseTrunkSortOrder - layerNum

- Vines:

  - Test using rb.Sleep when they are out of range //tested NoSleep and No active control on PC; not wbgl;
  - Consider running time forward at high speed while trees/vines are being placed in order to get them to settle into resting positions
  - Consider testing a linerenderer deactivation on out of range
  - ensure vineRoot (and probably all objects are destroyed after falling below a given y value)

  - for climbing: Try having player hinge onto a special object that is attached to the vine via a distance joint.

    - then, when climbing, set the distance joint to the target segment, and reduce the distance over time..Then update the target segment as the climb continues... might allow for smooth climb

  - the vine segment anchor needs to be same size as the segments

- Lights:

  - Experiment with RenderSettings (light render texture scale, etc.) in Settings folder/Renderer2D

- Player:

  - walking back and forth causes grunt noise; adjust bottom collider and legs colliders
  - Fix Swinging unpause
  - Check Amulet Colliders (might be the win platform collider, or the new player colliders; if the latter, try changing torso to box collider and ensure settings match orig collider.)

  - Add dust poof when player lands on platform

  - If player lands on a vine while climbing, momentum is not carried; They just stick
  - consider preventing climb if actively applying horizontal movement

- Factories:

  - change Generate methods to Instantiate
  - FactoryConfigs should maybe be changed to Blueprint and keep the object config ; EnvironmentObject is currently the opposite of this
  - consider changing scales to scale multipliers instead of applying absolute scaling

  - for mobile climb; may need to setup custom control that allows player to slide finger above and below the grab button (while grabbing)
    ... to climb up and down;

- Water:

  - try adding player collider and mask that allows player to enter the water while swinging, but it slows them down (increase linear drag on player while in water (proportional to pct of player in water)); Add splash drag sound and some particle effect;

- Set up player spawn point object;

  - set one up on StartPlatform prefab

- Setup bare bones options screen with TouchScreen textbox; init with isMobilePlatform.

  - Add to AppSettings in GameContext;
  - then consumers can reference AppSettings.isTouchScreen in GameContext to init
    - find and replace refs to isMobilePlatform

- Prevent keyboard controls display text on mobile

- make section tester (take layers, regenerate on validate, enable disable tree layers), allow converting to a preset

- Physics:
  - review Physics 2d settings; may help with vine stability

==========================================================================================

- UI
  -dl font ("Super easy")

  - Main Menu

    - Add options screen
      - quality settings:
        - adjusts lightshaft number;
        - shadow quality
        - lighting quality (adjust light texture)
        - Vsync

    Escape/Pause Menu: - stylize - add current stats

    - may need to manually set grab to true if player was grabbing on pause
    - include seed for copying

  - Add zone near amulet that, on enter, triggers "I can see the amulet ahead text"

  - review intro text

    - change "press spacebar" when using touchscreen controls

  - review about page (add link elsewhere)
  - change start menu upper right text
  - dont show keyboard control tutorial text if on mobile

    - also, provide option to stop it from showing up; and/or auto stop after ngames

  - Start Menu vines broken again from line renderer

MobileUI:

- Setup UI inputs based on GameContext //Ignoring for now.
- hide mobile ui controls on gameover.
- start menu vines position incorrect; try using a screenspace camera

- ipad webgl controls sometimes cause inadvertent pinch to minimize

==========================================================================================

- Data Persistance: - set up save/load for: - settings - scores and stats

      - Use ScriptableObject PlayerData
      	- Allow different characters? enter name?
      	- Save stats PlayerPrefs.setString(${playerName}+"/"+stats+"/"+maxSwing, etc
      		... same with cloth colors;
      		... Add to currency? Allow colors and clothing items bought with currency?

      	- ** Use ToJsonUtility
      		- we can save serializable classes
      		- try saving json string to string in player prefs; otherwise might need to check how Application.persistantDataPath works in webgl
      		- Setup a serializable class that represents the data to be saved, eg. PlayerStats
      - Fix save

==========================================================================================

- Gameplay:

  - Modes:

    - ArcadeMode (with jump) ?
    - EndlessMode: both sandbox and progressive difficulty:

      - achieve by generating sections of fixed length
        ... when player is nearing the end of the section (use some object as reference),
        ... generate a new section starting at the end of the old one and move or recreate the reference obj to the end of the new section;

        - For progressive difficulty, you can just increase spacing, height variance, vine weakness, and maybe chance of enemy encounter
          ... for enemy encounter, have the enemy engage from behind and last a period of time or for fixed distance that player must travel.. music fades out after the player escapes.

      - EndlessMode: review placement of new sections; ensure they're accounting for parallax

        - seems to be weird artifacts when new section is generated; Also maybe seems like bg might be overllaping? but don't see how.
        - You could also just init endless mode to be a really large length, then start extending if the player ever gets there.
        - Or, you could init a large initial section, then init the next section one layer at a time, depending on how close the player gets; so should be less noticable.
        - similarly, progressive danger mode can be sorted out ahead of time, each section placed at the beginning; then at the end, just extend the most difficult chunks.
        - Also, look into async instantiation; Maybe via coroutine to avoid stutters.. this might allow extending by larger chunks at a time.
          - maybe try corutine that instantiate one object per frame? yield waitfroendofframe
        - Maybe try using static Factories; Time the generation time of a length 10000 chunk with and without statics;

        - Or reuse objects from the beginning, reposition them every N units of distance, store the old positions in an array, and you can place them back if the player goes backward.

- Implement Difficulty coefficient and integrate it with treeSpacing, height, vine strength/pctWeak, pctChanceEnemyEncounter

- Setup Reusable Sections for endless mode

- Endless Format:

  - Player Travels and can reach platform check points where they can stop/save and perform actions

- Setup "practice"/"tutorial" section that has land?

- with character progression, Allow player to hire "rescue parties" (purchased as an item), which is consumed for each fail.
  ... if the player fails but owns a rescue party, their character will be rescued and preserved.
